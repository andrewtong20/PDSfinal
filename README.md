# PDSfinal Run Instructions

To run As1 and As2, enter "go run *.go". 

- This runs all files in same directory (best way to do this according to: https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/my-struct-wrote-in-separate-file-is-undefined-in-main-go/7757). There are no relative paths, so the paths would be different from computer to computer.
