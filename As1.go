This program finds the location, area, circumference, volume and surface area of the circle/sphere given a radius and x/y coordinates.
It also asks the user for meters and converts it into the corresponding number of miles, feet, and inches. Then it prints the meters and the miles, feet, and inches to "meters.txt"
Finally, it reads a line of text from the user, outputs the line with the first word moved to the end of the line, and prints the length of the string
